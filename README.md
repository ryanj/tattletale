#Tattltale
Written by Kyle Macnamara and Patrick Baxter for the iCTF2013. `Go run
tattletale.go` and `nc localhost 13007` and poke around! Kyle wrote the solver
and benign traffic. I wrote the go part. Cobbled together in a week, the code
got a little disorganized, but the chat primitives are pretty solid. No
bugs were reported during the CTF and no crashes.
